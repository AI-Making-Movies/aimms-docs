I am developing a mkdocs site.

I need to make sure the licensing information is correctly stated anywhere it is mentioned.

I have updated the index.md page with the correct information to clarify that version 2.x is a paid upgrade after purchase of version 1.x 

I just need to make sure there is no inaccurate information that can be used to claim a free upgrade to vrs 2.x later or a customer make out they did not know 1.x was the license limit.

on `index.md` the relevant section I updated to clarify that is here

```text
- **A full license gives you perpetual license for v1.x and all versions of 1.x. Future versions 2.x onward will be paid upgrades.** This is because version 2.x will include API and additional services requiring a major coding period (planned for > 2027 at earliest). Version 1.x will include patches, minor updates and upgrades to improve existing functionality.
```

can you check through all other folders under `docs` folder only and review and report back if you find entries that might present the licensing info in a confusing manner or not point back to the information shown above.

review, report back, then stop.
