# Starred Images

## Overview

The starred image system in AIMMS helps you identify and manage your favorite or best-quality image takes for each shot. This feature provides a simple way to mark preferred versions, prioritize workflow, and maintain quality control throughout your project.

## Understanding the Starred Image System

### What Are Starred Images?

Starred images are your favorites - the best versions of each shot's base image. This system helps you:

- **Quick Identification**: Easily find your best takes
- **Quality Control**: Maintain clear standards for image quality
- **Workflow Focus**: Concentrate improvement efforts on non-starred images
- **Export Priority**: Use starred images for exports and presentations

### Star System Rules

**One Star Per Shot**
- Only one image per shot can be starred at a time
- Prevents confusion about which version is preferred
- Maintains clear quality hierarchy

**Automatic Management**
- Stars are managed automatically by AIMMS
- No manual file system changes required
- Consistent behavior across the application

**Visual Indicators**
- Starred images are highlighted in the gallery
- Clear visual distinction from non-starred images
- Easy identification at a glance
