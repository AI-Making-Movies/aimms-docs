# Image Storyboard Overview

## Introduction

The Image Storyboard module is where you view and manage all the base images for your shots. This gallery-style interface displays thumbnails of all your images, making it easy to review, organize, and manage your visual assets.

## Understanding the Image Gallery

The image storyboard displays all base images for your shots in a grid layout. Each thumbnail represents a "take" - a version of the base image for that shot.

### Gallery Layout

- **Grid View**: Images displayed in rows and columns
- **Shot Organization**: Images grouped by shot (you can filter by section)
- **Thumbnail Quality**: Optimized thumbnails for fast loading
- **Metadata Display**: Key information shown on hover or in details

### Image Take Information

Each image take shows:
- **Shot Name**: Which shot this image belongs to
- **Take Number**: Version number (e.g., base_01, base_02)
- **File Format**: Image type and quality indicators
- **Star Status**: Whether this take is starred/favorite

## Key Features

### Workflow Integration

**Shot Workflow**
- Images are part of the shot creation workflow
- Base images influence video generation
- Metadata flows between modules

**Quality Control**
- Starred images indicate preferred versions
- Easy comparison between takes
- Clear progression of image quality
