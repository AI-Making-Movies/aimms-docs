**AIMMS version 1.0 (StorM) due to be released in Q1 2026** 

AIMMS Version 1.0 (StorM) is a passive storyboard management system for tracking image and video clips as well as assets, clip info, and workflows for use in making AI short films.

AIMMS runs locally, cross-platform, and does not need a GPU to run. It will work with small or large projects (tested up to 20K takes in 600 shots). 

Future versions will integrate directly with ComfyUI via API, and will include optional advanced LLM prompting as well as selectable batch rendering features.

Additional services such as the [**AIMMS migration-tool**](https://github.com/mdkberry/migrating-to-aimms) are available for migration, and related ComfyUI custom nodes will be made available via the [github page](https://github.com/mdkberry).

- Tutorials and discussions on features and useage will be posted to the [YT Channel @ markdkberry](https://www.youtube.com/@markdkberry)
