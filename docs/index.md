![AIMMS version 1.0 (StorM)](images/general/about-image.png)

**AIMMS version 1.0 (StorM) will be released in Q1 2026** 

AIMMS Version 1.0 (StorM) is a passive storyboard management system for tracking image and video clips as well as assets, clip info, and workflows for use in making AI short films. It runs locally, cross-platform, and does not need a GPU to run.

Future versions will integrate directly with ComfyUI via API, and will include optional advanced LLM prompting as well as selectable batch rendering features.

This application is being developed by [www.MarkDKBerry.com](https://www.markdkberry.com). Additional services such as the [**AIMMS migration-tool**](https://github.com/mdkberry/migrating-to-aimms) or other useful ComfyUI nodes will be available from the [github page](https://github.com/mdkberry).

Tutorials and discussions on features and useage will be posted to the [YT Channel @ markdkberry](https://www.youtube.com/@markdkberry).
