![AIMMS version 1.0 (StorM)](images/general/about-image.png)

## AIMMS v1.0 (StorM)

**AIMMS version 1.0 (StorM)** is a passive storyboard and asset management system designed for tracking image and video clips, shot metadata, and workflows used in the creation of AI-generated short films.

AIMMS runs locally, is cross-platform, and does not require a GPU. It is suitable for both small and large projects (tested up to 21,000 takes across 600 shots).

Future versions may integrate directly with ComfyUI via API and may include optional advanced LLM-assisted prompting and batch rendering features.

Additional tools, such as the [**AIMMS migration tool**](https://github.com/mdkberry/migrating-to-aimms), are available to assist with onboarding existing projects.

## Licensing & Support

- AIMMS is a **one-time purchase** desktop application. Purchasing a license grants you the right to use the software as-is.

- AIMMS is **not sold with guaranteed support**, live assistance, or response-time commitments.

- Bug reports, issues, and feature suggestions can be submitted via  
  [**GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/AI-Making-Movies/aimms-docs/issues)

  Please note:
  - Issues are reviewed and addressed **at the developer’s discretion**
  - Responses and fixes are provided **when time permits**
  - Submitting an issue does **not** guarantee a response or resolution

This approach allows AIMMS to remain a focused, independently developed tool rather than a subscription-based service.
