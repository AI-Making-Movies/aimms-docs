## AIMMS v1.0 (StorM)

*"Visual storyboarding of my AI short videos was something I needed after running into "shot tracking overwhelm" using only a csv. So, I built AIMMS initially for myself but was soon being asked for access to it. This is the result of that. - Mark"*

**AIMMS version 1.0 (StorM)** is a passive storyboard management system designed for tracking image and video clips, shot metadata, assets, and workflows used in the creation of AI-generated short films.

AIMMS runs locally, is cross-platform, and does not require a GPU. It is suitable for both small and large projects (tested up to 21,000 takes across 600 shots).

Future versions may integrate directly with ComfyUI via API and may include optional advanced LLM-assisted prompting and batch rendering features.

Additional tools, such as the [**AIMMS migration tool**](https://github.com/mdkberry/migrating-to-aimms) *(in development)*, are available to assist with onboarding existing media sets.
